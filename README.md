# Restaurand Landing Page

See the result [here](https://restaurand-lp.vercel.app/)

This project initialy had the proposal to be a test to a job opportunity, following some instructions held by the company. However, as the project was evolving, using tools that I didn't use before or never used, I decided to use this in my portifolio, because I really enjoy it when I was learning more while I developing the sections.

How does it works 🔍

- The project is a landing page constructed only using HTML, SASS and GULP to preprocess the code

- The theme it's a restaurant using some images for unsplash.

- Targeting agility to develop and keep the code easy to maintain, I discovered a way to work as I work with components on frameworks like Vue.js and React.js, using the lib gulp-file-include.

- Beside that, are used other gulp libs to generate the code on the dir 'dist' with all code minified and in one file.

💡 May the LP had some little different details of the Wireframe provided, but I had the caution to keep it only on small things that the knowledge behind them is implied elsewhere.
